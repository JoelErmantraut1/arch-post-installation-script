# arch-post-installation-script
A group of scripts to run after a clean installation of Arch Linux.

Based in [ArchMatic](https://github.com/rickellis/ArchMatic)

It installs all the utilities and application that I used to have. Also, it clones my config files from my
repository and places them in the correct places.
